# Building a Neural Network from Scratch
## Project Overview
A neural network is a constellation of neurons or nodes arranged in layers. Each node takes in an input, processes that input based on the mathematical function in the particular layer it is situated and produces an interim or final output - depending on where its layered in the network.

This project disambiguates what happens in a neural network by building one. The project
* examines the theory behind a n-layered neural network
* builds a 2 layer neural network from scratch using ReLU and Softmax as an activation function
* Evaluates accuracy on training, validation and test results with the Fashion MNIST dataset
